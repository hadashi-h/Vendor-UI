# Vendor-UI

A simple Vendor UI for a RPG game. Made with JS (jQuery), HTML, Scss 

### Requirements
A machine with Node.js installed, so that npm can be run ;) More details here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

### To run locally
Enter the project folder named *Vendor-UI-master*

Run the next two commands in terminal in the project folder.
To install npm dependencies:
```
npm install
```
To start the localhost server:
```
npm run gulp
```

Now you can open the index.html file and try to buy all the things from the vendor ;)
